Windows Explorer Navigation Pane Configuration

The Windows Explorer Navigation Pane Configuration Tool (WENPCFG) enables you 
to show or hide the following nodes and their sub nodes in the navigation pane of 
Windows Explorer and also in the Open- and Save-File-Dialogs introduced in Windows 7, 
Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012.

*	Libraries
*	Favorites
*	Computer
*	Network
*	Home Group
*	User Files
*	OneDrive (experimental for Windows 10)
*	Quick Access (experimental for Windows 10)

NOTE: Changing the configuration of Windows 
Explorer to show or hide any of the above nodes 
affects every user logging on to this computer. 
It is not possible to set this per user. It is a 
machine based configuration.

WENPCFG is a command line application and is 
only intended for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and 
Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 10. 

Running WENPCFG requires elevated privileges.

After applying configuration changes you have to restart 
Explorer shell process (not only an explorer window).  
Simply logoff and logon your windows session.
